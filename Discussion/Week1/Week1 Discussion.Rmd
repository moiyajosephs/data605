## Week 1 Discussion

Chapter M Exercise C11 page 172

## The Problem
Solve the given vector equation for x, or explain why no solution exists.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("ProblemC11.png")
```

Where the first matrix is `matrix1`, the answer in this problem is `matrix2` and the second matrix is what we are going to solve for and is named `answer`.

```{r}
matrix1 <- matrix(c(1,0,2,4,3,2), nrow = 2)
print(matrix1)

matrix2 <- matrix(c(-1,0,1,5,0,-2), nrow = 2)
print(matrix2)

answer<- (2*matrix1 - matrix2)/3
answer

```

## Checking the math
```{r}
2*matrix1 -3*answer
```
The `answer` matrix where `x=2` when substituted into the initial equation gave the same resulting matrix.
